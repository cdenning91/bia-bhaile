# Bia Bhaile


Bia Bhaile is a website for anyone with an interest in having a littel fun in the kitchen. It's a relaxed take on a traditional cooking website.

This website was designed to be viewed on multiple devices and can adapt with the users preferece. 

The aim of this project is to create a user friendly community space. Easy to use space to view or download recipes, submit pictures or just get in touch.

## Design

### Colour Scheme 

Bia Bhaile's signature colour is a strong yellow (#fad02c) tied with white, black & light greys.

### Typography

I have chosen the elegant Raleway as the core font-family for Bia Bhaile as it simplistic & clear for better user experience. I have also included Sans-Serif incase there are any browser difficulties. 

### Imagery

Giving the nature of Bia Bhaile, I wanted to have vibrant & apatizing imagery throughout the site. Based on user experience I did not want to over crowd with picutres so that the main focus is drawn to the recipes. All imagery used is my own.

### Testing User Experience 

#### First Time User:

* User is immidately greeted with clear branding & user friendly navigation


#### Returning User:

* When navigated by an initial user, I received some feedback about the accessiblity for people with sight issues - at this time the dropdown menu had an almost transparent background (rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.5) which may have been harder to see so I adjusted this to be more user friendly with a white background. 

* Responsive - any user submittions on Contact or Subscribe direct the user back to the navigation when submitted.

* Easy to find contact navigation

#### Frequent User:

* Social Media links clear in the footer
* Easy to see send submissions & to view previous users pictures

### Troubleshooting

I had an issue with hover dropdown menu which & found [this](https://bootstrap-menu.com/detail-basic-hover.html) site helpfully to figure out the issues I was having.

I had an issue with toggle nav not showing on smaller screens & found some good advise from [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36544961/bootstrap-navbar-toggle-not-showing-in-mobile) forum

I worked with Bootstrap V5 for this project, I adapted & studied the documents available via [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) & applied what I had learned throughout the course. 


## Bugs

Recipe page - layout is flawed, issues with placement of containers
